<h1>Leveraging ChatGPT as a Coding Tool for Systematic Analysis of Extensive Mendeley Document Collection</h1>

The efficient management and organization of an extensive document library in the academic research reflects the ongoing development of knowledge and expertise. 
Since 2011, I have diligently accumulated a substantial collection of academic documents in Mendeley with diverse research interests. Several attempts have been made to extract meaningful insights from this extensive archive, with the most recent endeavor taking place in the summer of 2022.
This study explores the use of ChatGPT as an assistant-style Chatbot to convert a vast collection of academic documents from Mendeley into insightful graphs, concise summaries, and other tasks tailored to user needs.  
Moreover, this study can also be applied to alternative reference management tools such as Zotero. Additionally, it demonstrates practical scalability to handle the analysis of substantial number of publications in PDF format.

<h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
The results of the analysis are presented through a series of visualizations, including bar plots
depicting publication trends over the years, distribution of document types, and insights into
prominent publishers and journals. Word clouds and interactive widgets offer an engaging
visualization of user tags and enable detailed exploration of individual publications.
Furthermore, the incorporation of ChatGPT for topic modeling provides a comprehensive
understanding of the overarching themes within the document collection. The generated graphs
and summaries offer a distilled representation of the knowledge landscape encapsulated in the
Mendeley documents.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
This study showcases the successful integration of ChatGPT as a utility for analyzing a sub-
stantial collection of Mendeley documents. The use of advanced natural language processing
techniques, coupled with dynamic visualizations, transforms the traditional approach to docu-
ment analysis. As a result, researchers and academics can derive valuable insights from their
document repositories, enhancing the efficiency and depth of knowledge extraction.
In summary, the synergy between Mendeley and ChatGPT presents a compelling narrative
of innovation and adaptability in the ever-evolving landscape of academic research. This project
not only underscores the potential of AI-driven tools in document analysis but also serves as
an inspiration for future endeavors aimed at unlocking the wealth of knowledge embedded in
extensive document repositories.
Future work may involve further optimization of the search algorithm, exploration of addi-
tional natural language processing techniques, and extending the application to other domains.
Moreover, integration of ChatGPT 4.0 plugins into the analysis pipeline could provide a dynamic
and context-aware approach to understanding the nuances of the docume
