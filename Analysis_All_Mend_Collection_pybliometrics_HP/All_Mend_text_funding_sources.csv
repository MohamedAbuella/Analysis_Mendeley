The high level of energy generation from nuclear and brown coal in Germany generates stiffness in the system, because nuclear power and brown coal plant can
only be used for base load
Fixed price incentives are required, if wind, brown coal and nuclear generation
should be the main generation sources
The need of wind to act as ancillary service increases with the amount of wind and
constant nuclear power and brown coal generation
Low average wind speeds cause additional surplus of power generation from fossil
and nuclear power, whenever there is strong wind during periods of low demand
Offshore wind power helps to reduce the number of hours with negative prices compared to a scenario of equivalent amount of generation at lower average wind
speeds on land
It is rather the total amount of wind generation than the penetration level that
causes price volatility
Germany has operated since many years with different day and night prices for the
consumers in some areas to reduce the diurnal cycle of the demand",['DEWEPS']

The peer performance of hedge funds
David Ardia, Laval University; Kris Boudt, Vrije Universiteit Brussel
The industry standard to measure the peer performance of hedge funds is to rank the funds based on their
risk–adjusted performance and conclude that the fund outperforms the peers with a worse ranking","['ISF', 'Laval University']"
"When
all funds perform equally well, this rate of out–performance is a random number between zero and one,
depending on how lucky the fund is",[]
"Consistent with the presence of decreasing
returns to capital, we find that the under–performance rate tends to increase when the fund has more assets
under management and that, because of reputation risk, large funds with a long track record tend to have a
higher equal–performance ratio",[]
"The estimation of pax demand
per route is of extreme importance not only for opening new routes and business opportunities, it is also
important for government investment decisions such as the increase of airport infrastructure and the
enhancement of new markets, such decisions must be supported by proper planning, which depends
directly on a good forecast of pax demand",[]

2018 Wind Technologies Market Report

Executive Summary
Wind power capacity in the United States continued to grow robustly in 2018, supported by the industry’s
primary federal incentive—the production tax credit (PTC)—as well as a myriad of state-level policies","['International Trade Commission', 'WECC', 'Western Electricity Coordinating Council', 'Wind Technologies Market Report']"
"Supported by favorable tax policy and other factors,
cumulative wind power capacity grew to 96,433 MegaWatts (MW)","['MegaWatts', 'MW']"
"The decline in specific power has been a major
contributor to higher capacity factors, but has been offset to a degree by a tendency—especially from
2009 to 2012, when a cash grant was available in lieu of the PTC—toward building projects at lowerquality wind sites",[]
"Recent and projected
near-term growth is supported by the industry’s primary federal incentive—the production tax credit (PTC)—
having been extended (with a phase-out schedule) through 2019 as well as a myriad of state-level policies",[]
"Further information on distributed wind power, which includes smaller wind turbines as well as the use of
larger turbines in distributed applications, is available through a separate annual report funded by the U",[]
"A companion study funded by DOE that focuses
exclusively on offshore wind power is also available—the 2018 Offshore Wind Technologies Market Report",[]
"27 A “partnership flip” is a project finance structure in which the developer or project sponsor partners with a third-party tax equity
investor to jointly invest in and own part of the project",[]
"Initially, allocations of tax benefits are skewed heavily in favor the tax equity
partner (which is able to efficiently monetize the tax benefits), but eventually “flip” in favor of the project sponsor partner once the
tax benefits have been largely exhausted",[]
"Cash is also allocated between the partners, with one or more “flip” events, but in recent
years has been increasingly directed toward the project sponsor to the extent possible, in order to support back leverage or
dividend payments to YieldCo investors",['YieldCo']
"For example, wind
projects built in the four-year period from 2009 through 2012 were able to access a 30% cash grant (or ITC) in
lieu of the PTC",['ITC']
"Many projects availed themselves of this opportunity and, because the dollar amount of the
grant (or ITC) was not dependent on how much electricity a project generates, it is possible that developers
also seized this limited opportunity to build out the less-energetic sites in their development pipelines",['ITC']

was only available to wind projects that were placed in service from 2009 to 2012 (and that had started construction prior to the end of
2011), and was widely used during that period",['ITC']

irrespective of whether the conditions for the grant of a
breeder’s right are fully met, can be defined by the expression
of the characteristics resulting from a given genotype or

"Discussion
As shown in the Figures in the previous section, the different climate
models yield different responses expressed as the values of indicators of
climate change, and they often also do not agree on the direction of how
the particular value of the future projections will change compared to
the reference period, a heterogeneous behaviour supported by previous
studies [18,19]",[]

"In fact, if you are given a start-up fund at the beginning of your tenure-track
assistant professor assignment, I would recommend seizing recruitment (and holding onto
these funds) for approximately 1–2 years until you build your profile as a researcher and
position yourself as an expert in your narrow field",[]
"When I
became an assistant professor of petroleum engineering in 2016, I was granted a startup
fund of $100,000 to build my research team",[]
"Later, after the student spent a semester worth of the startup fund
and dropped out from the graduate school, his supervisor met me during one of the
department meetings and said, “Oh, he was a bad student and I kicked him out from my
team, I did not want to waste money on him any longer",[]
"I was in rush for several years after the start of my career, and I made not one but
three costly mistakes which led to half of my startup fund being spent; none of these three
students graduated with MS or PhD, and no publications with their and my name ever came
out",['MS']
"These funds are usually
expended by the administration (yes, up to 50% or more of grant money can be diverted
for administrative purposes) and the research team(s) led by the primary grant applicant(s)",[]
"So how do you maintain your sanity when you dive into the process of filing
grant applications that usually have a 10% success rate at best",[]
"Maybe somebody (such
as another PI or administration) who will inherit your grant money after you are gone will
but is this the scenario that you really want",['PI']
"You might argue that this is exactly what I write in my grant proposals—that “my
research will help solve such and such problem”—but this is not true",[]
"You might also get to
know somebody in some company who might be interested in either fully or partially
funding your research and their matching will increase your chances of getting a grant",[]
"A definite goal (which is not “getting a grant and
then starting research” but rather “having a highly productive research team with
interesting ideas and great results”) and consistent actions toward this goal summon the
energy that helps achieve it",[]
"Do not allow yourself to become convinced that
without grant(s) you will not secure such tenure or promotion because this is a mind trap
that will keep you unhappy, emotionally unstable, and mentally unhealthy for several years
preceding tenure or promotion review",[]

preparations several months before the grant application date and work on the application
only during this allocated time",[]

negative feedback or rejection",[]
"When you decide that grant proposal writing is only one of
many activities that you are doing toward your definite goals, you will not be easily swayed
by the decisions made regarding your applications",[]
"Making the creation of a prolific
research team instead of securing a grant your goal will summon forces and energy to help
you attain this goal and money will come as a byproduct or a means of achieving the goal",[]
"For instance, put together a list where you stipulate for yourself
that during your pre-tenure years you will limit your services to the following (you can
change the duration to an amount you find suitable):
Department committee (1 each year)
Supervisory student committee (5–7 each year)

Due to pressure from the World Bank, the
Kenyan government took a series of steps to
loosen its control over clusters between 1990
and 2001, this included:
i) 1991 - pulling out of cooperative
management;
ii) 1995 - ending financial support to
cooperatives (Kenya Planters Cooperative
Union and the Coffee Research Foundation
(CRF));
iii) 1999 - relaxing regulation of upstream
processes and allowing growers to choose
among pulping factories, millers, and
marketing agents;
iv) 2001 - limiting the role of the CBK as a
regulator;
v) privatizing the coffee auction and allowing a

portion of coffee to bypass the auction and
to be sold directly to exporters;
vi) 2006 - increasing the number of marketing
licenses issued from three to twenty-five
(Muthoni, 2014)","['the World Bank', 'Kenya Planters Cooperative\r\nUnion', 'the Coffee Research Foundation', 'CBK']"
"During this period a
number of members in the coffee value chain
were interviewed including farmers, wet/dry
millers, millers, Coffee Research Institute,
Coffee Directorate, Commodities Fund and the
representative of these institutions for each
coffee grower county","['Coffee Research Institute', 'Coffee Directorate']"

of seeds and distribution of planting materials",[]
"Moreover, 60% of the fund will be used

processing infrastructure and the quality of
coffee by automating co-operatives systems

standard deviation of the percentage excess return, over n = 50 months, for the
first five managers in the Fund dataset",[]

√
( n · X̄/S) and associated p-value for testing H0j : µj = 0, the null hypothesis
that the (population) mean return for the jth hedge fund manager equals zero",[]
"We will illustrate these approaches on the Fund dataset, which records the
monthly percentage excess returns for 2,000 fund managers over n = 50
months",[]
"6 implies that
α

the market’s overall return",[]

the fund manager achieves a 7% return, their excess return would be 7% − 5% = 2%",[]
We now consider the Fund dataset in Table 13,[]

conclude that the first and third managers have significantly non-zero excess returns; in other words, we will reject H01 : µ1 = 0 and H03 : µ3 = 0",[]

in the Fund dataset in Table 13",[]

"Finally, the revenues of the Fund would be
used to stimulate a transition towards low/zero-carbon fuels and technologies",[]
"The measure proposes the establishment of a mandatory contribution fund

inconsistency of the market, simply because the contribution is collected as the fuel is consumed by the

impact of an MBM","['GHG Fund', 'the International Union', 'IUCN', 'MBM']"
"Their investigation concluded that among the proposals, the GHG
Fund is much more environmentally practical and cost-effective",['GHG\r\nFund']

collected to a fund and be used in various means, such as for in-sector technical and operational
improvements, offset credits purchasing in the emission trading markets, or adaptation mechanisms

irrespective of whether the conditions for the grant of a
breeder’s right are fully met, can be defined by the expression
of the characteristics resulting from a given genotype or

Directive, at least 50% of the revenues generated by the auctioning of ETS allowances
should be directed to a set of activities contributing to the EU’s mitigation action, including,
among others:

paragraph 2, let","['the Innovation Fund', 'ETS', 'EU']"
"From this standpoint, projects eligible

to contribute substantially to mitigating climate change, as well as products substituting
carbon intensive ones produced in the sectors listed in Annex I of the ETS Directive, and
will help stimulate the construction and operation of low-carbon projects",['the Innovation Fund']

Fund projects will be assessed against a multiple set of criteria including effectiveness,

attain the EU’s climate and energy targets, enhance the financing of renewable energy
sources, and promote best practices among them and other Member States","['the Modernisation Fund', 'EU', 'Slovakia', 'EU']"
"The Modernisation Fund builds on the 2% of the total allowances (for 2021–2030) auctioned under the
ETS",['The Modernisation Fund']
"Notably, the Modernisation Fund should be channeled to support investments in
the generation and use of electricity from renewable sources, the improvement of energy
efficiency, energy storage, and the modernization of energy networks (at least 70%), as well
as investments in energy efficiency technology in transport",['the Modernisation Fund']

emissions’ impacts of cold ironing and maximizing its environmental and CO2 benefits [22]",['GHG']

INTRODUCTION
Background
As stated by Anjorin (2014), economic development and a nation’s
maintainability is supported by energy sufficiency",[]
"The following are the steps in the BCA process;
1) Identify all users’ benefits expected to arise from the project, 2) quantify these
benefits in dollar terms as much as possible, so that different benefits may be
compared against one another and against the costs of attaining them, 3) identify
sponsor’s or capital costs, 4) quantify these costs in dollar terms as much as
possible, to allow comparisons, 5) determine the equivalent benefits and costs
during the base period; use an interest rate appropriate for the project and 6)
accept the project if the equivalent users’ benefits exceed the equivalent capital
costs",['BCA']

Retail Electricity Pricing Inquiry—Final Report

The ACCC is recommending a package of changes to improve retail outcomes and experiences
for consumers:

abolishing the standing offer and replacing it with a lower-priced ‘default offer’ which can be
priced no higher than a level determined by the AER (recommendation 30)

requiring any advertising of discounts by retailers to be unconditional and referenced to the
default offer rate (recommendation 32)

restricting conditional discounts to be no more than the reasonable savings to the retailer from
the condition being met (recommendation 33)
pursuing access to data for electricity users through the Consumer Data Right
(recommendation 31)

a prescribed mandatory code of conduct for third party intermediaries which includes an

obligation that any recommended offer is in the best interests of the consumer (rather than on
the basis of the intermediary’s commercial relationships) (recommendation 34)

clarifying explicit informed consent provisions to make clear that consumers can provide their
consent to third party intermediaries to give explicit informed consent (EIC) on their behalf
(recommendation 35)

improving concession schemes including by applying a means test to ensure they are targeted

at those most in need and instituting a hybrid approach to applying energy concessions that is
consistent across the NEM, including a fixed dollar amount to offset daily supply charges and a
percentage discount to offset variable usage charges (recommendation 37)

additional government funding (to a value of $5 per household in each NEM region, or $43 million
NEM-wide, per annum) for a grant scheme for consumer and community organisations to
provide targeted support to assist vulnerable consumers to improve energy market literacy
(recommendation 38)

increases in penalties to all civil penalty provisions to the same levels as those to be introduced in

the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) ($10 million, three times the benefit gained or 10 per cent of
turnover) (recommendation 42)","['ACCC', 'AER', 'Consumer Data Right', 'EIC', 'NEM', 'NEM', 'ACL']"
"Governments should fund small business organisations ($10 million over three years) to provide
tailored retail electricity market advice (recommendation 52)",[]
"Governments should appropriately fund communication campaigns around the benefits of costreflective pricing and smart meters to build community acceptance and awareness of individual and
community wide benefits, as well as customer awareness of their rights",[]
"In addition to existing funding, the Australian Government and the relevant state or territory
government should fund (to a value of $5 per household in each NEM region, or $43 million
NEM-wide, per annum) a grant scheme for consumer and community organisations to provide
targeted support to assist vulnerable consumers to improve energy literacy","['the Australian Government', 'NEM']"
"This grant scheme
should be modelled on the approach taken by the Queensland Council of Social Services
in administering the Switched on Communities program","['the Queensland Council of Social Services', 'Communities']"
"State and territory governments should fund small business organisations to provide tailored retail
electricity market advice",[]
"The fund should total $10 million over three years and be awarded on a
competitive basis to small business representative organisations providing information, tools and
advice to small businesses on retail electricity choices",[]
"126

Any market manipulation rule would need to be supported by stronger information, investigation
and enforcement powers for the AER",['AER']
"This results in a market failure where some large industrial or manufacturing customers with high
electricity needs are unable to invest in, or sponsor, low-cost sources of generation in the same way
that major electricity retailers or some large corporate customers have done",[]
"There is no doubt that this conduct is significantly
affecting the ability of smaller retailers to gain scale in the market, and that the ability for the big three
to engage in such aggressive activity is to a significant extent funded by their inherited customer bases",[]
"301 See for example, Grant, H, Assets or Liabilities","['Grant, H']"
"309 Grant estimated that the asset base of networks in the NEM should be written down by about $38bn—see Grant, H, Assets or
Liabilities","['NEM', 'Grant, H']"
"Potentially one option would be that, if an opt-out framework is implemented,
tariffs could be set to tilt people towards not opting out, and supported by information programs and
other incentives",[]

"Governments should appropriately fund communication campaigns around the benefits of cost
reflective pricing and smart meters to build community acceptance and awareness of individual and
community wide benefits, as well as customer awareness of their rights",[]
"Efforts
by retailers to date to capture the benefits of demand response from smaller customers appear limited
to a number of small retailers partnering with demand response providers, or to trials supported by
ARENA (such as the AGL and Simply Energy ‘virtual power plants’ in South Australia, Powershop’s
behavioural trial and Pooled Energy’s trial of pool control systems)","['AGL', 'Simply Energy ‘', 'Pooled Energy’s']"
"These disclosure
and consultation requirements are supported by a Demand side engagement strategy setting out how a
network will engage with non-network providers and consider non-network options",[]
"The tariff, to apply from 1 July 2018 on an opt-in basis, was supported by the project coordinators",[]
"As set out in chapter 1, the data available to the ACCC indicates that environmental schemes make up
about 6 per cent of an average customer bill in the NEM in 2017–18, although this percentage varies
from 4 per cent in Queensland (which recently decided to fund its solar bonus scheme from taxation) to
10 per cent in South Australia (which has a very high take up of rooftop solar PV systems)","['ACCC', 'NEM']"
"444 NSW Government, NSW Climate Change Fund Annual Report 2016–17, November 2017, p","['NSW Government', 'NSW Climate Change Fund Annual Report']"
"Those households that
have installed solar PV already have been able to access a significant subsidy which has for many
years been funded by non-solar customers",[]
"Now that the cost of solar PV is much lower, and arguably
within reach of more households, removing the SRES would leave new installers to fund the full cost of
any installation",['SRES']
"Secondly, these generous payments are funded by all other users, who must pay
for these amounts in increased charges",[]
"In the case of the NSW Solar Bonus Scheme, which ceased premium tariff payments at the end of 2016,
the ACCC notes that funds are still being collected by distributors and paid to the NSW Government’s
Climate Change Fund","['NSW', 'ACCC', 'the NSW Government’s']"
"For example, in 2015–16, the last full year of the Solar Bonus Scheme, the
Climate Change Fund collected $309 million in revenue directly from the three NSW distributors","['Climate Change Fund', 'NSW']"
"461 NSW Government, NSW Climate Change Fund Annual Report 2015–16, September 2016, p",['NSW Climate Change Fund Annual Report']
"462
However, the revenue received by the fund in 2016–17 did not decrease by a commensurate amount
to reflect the FiT payments no longer being made in the second half of the year",['FiT']
"The NSW
Government also consulted in 2016 on a Draft Strategic Plan for the Climate Change Fund","['NSW', 'the Climate Change Fund']"
"The ACCC notes the Queensland Government decision in 2017 to fund its Solar Bonus Scheme to the
value of $771 million in its budget for three years, rather than from consumers through distributor
charges","['ACCC', 'Queensland Government']"
"This would have the effect of removing the following amounts from the average residential
customer bill:

Victoria—$19 per year
NSW—$25 (by either stopping the collection of the money through distributor charges or taking the
funding of the climate change fund directly on budget)

Queensland—zero compared to 2017–18, as the scheme is currently on budget (but the cost would
otherwise be about $72)

South Australia—$72
Tasmania—$45",[]

is supplying energy to the household at the same time that the solar PV system is exporting to the

Improving concession schemes

The main way that vulnerable consumers are provided with financial support to pay their electricity
bills is through state and territory concession schemes",[]
"This supports feedback from consumer advocates that awareness and understanding of concession
schemes is a key barrier to consumers accessing financial support from governments",[]
"One retailer’s internal
document stated that ‘[c]ustomers are often deterred by the manual and lengthy process [for Utility Relief Grant Scheme and Home
Energy Emergency Assistance Scheme], or, are unaware of their entitlement",[]

that migrants and refugees are often in need of financial support but do not receive concessions, as
well as the working poor who do not have concession cards",['ACCC']

ACCC findings

The ACCC considers that each year governments across the NEM should jointly resource a grant
scheme to fund community and consumer organisations to provide targeted assistance to vulnerable
consumers to improve energy literacy and assist them to find lower-priced offers","['ACCC', 'NEM']"
"306

Retail Electricity Pricing Inquiry—Final Report

We note that ECA currently administers a grant scheme for consumer advocates across the NEM","['ECA', 'NEM']"
"Given the targeted nature of this funding, we consider that the Council of Social Services in each NEM
region are equally well equipped to administer this grant scheme, as was the case for Switched on
Communities in Queensland","['the Council of Social Services', 'NEM']"
"Recommendation 38
In addition to existing funding, the Australian Government and the relevant state or territory
government should jointly fund (to a value of $5 per household in each NEM region, or $43 million
NEM-wide, per annum) a grant scheme for consumer and community organisations to provide
targeted support to assist vulnerable consumers to improve energy literacy","['the Australian Government', 'NEM']"
"This grant scheme
should be modelled on the approach taken by the Queensland Council of Social Services
in administering the Switched on Communities program","['the Queensland Council of Social Services', 'Communities']"
"It also demonstrates that at a certain point, payment
plans and hardship programs are of limited benefit to some consumers and that the assistance provided
by financial counsellors and other grant schemes for vulnerable consumers plays a crucial role",[]
"The ACCC considers that it is important that governments continue to
appropriately fund consumer and small business groups to advocate on behalf of their constituents
during policy and regulatory processes",['ACCC']
"As such, we reiterate the
importance of measures to guarantee this funding and our recommendation concerning well-targeted
and sustained government grant schemes for consumer advocates",[]
"2: Current energy efficiency projects aimed at helping
vulnerable consumers
The Australian Government has issued a three-year grant to ECA to undertake the Power Shift
Project, a review of low income energy efficiency programs","['The Australian Government', 'ECA']"
"Under the program, the Council will fund the supply and
installation of 2 kW solar PV energy systems",['Council']
"In particular, there

is no transparency over what consumers are actually paying, the reports are not supported by
effective information gathering powers, and there are significant gaps in the reporting of business
and consumer outcomes",[]
"The national energy laws should be supported by comprehensive and appropriate penalties to
ensure businesses comply with their responsibilities and consumers are protected",[]
"Current price
reporting only provides estimates of consumer bills based on benchmark usage amounts

the way pricing is constructed (including the applied assumptions and methodologies) by the
different reporting bodies varies and pricing results are not readily comparable

none of the reports are supported by effective information gathering powers to allow regulators or
governments to have a full understanding of retail costs and margins, and other complementary
information like what types of offers consumers are on

while there is duplication of effort around residential prices, there are also significant gaps

particularly around business customer price reporting and outcomes",[]
"The ACCC sees merit in a strengthened price reporting function being allocated to the
AER, supported by powers to compulsorily obtain information from electricity retailers","['ACCC', 'AER']"
"For this
reason, government support will be needed to specifically fund these functions",[]
"Recommendation 52
State and territory governments should fund small business organisations to provide tailored retail
electricity market advice",[]
"The fund should total $10 million over three years and be awarded on a
competitive basis to small business representative organisations providing information, tools and
advice to small businesses on retail electricity choices",[]
"However,
documents reviewed during the Inquiry indicate retailer efforts in this regard are ad hoc in nature rather
than supported by consistent internal policies",['Inquiry']
"For instance, where contractual disputes
arise between a retailer and a medium-sized business these are best addressed by civil arbitration
and legal processes as they can be more complex than small customer disputes supported by energy
ombudsmen services",[]
"951
Second tier retailers like Tango Energy, the retail arm of Pacific Hydro, have also entered into PPAs with
large commercial buyers like the City of Melbourne, referenced above as the MREP authorised group
buyer, to fund new renewable energy projects, like an 80 MW wind farm in Crowlands","['Tango Energy', 'Pacific Hydro', 'MREP', 'MW']"

"Following is an example of how to calculate cost
sharing amounts for a project with $1,000,000 in federal funds with a minimum 20% nonfederal cost sharing requirement:
•

Formula: Federal share ($) divided by Federal share (%) = Total Project Cost
Example: $1,000,000 divided by 80% = $1,250,000

•

Formula: Total Project Cost ($) minus Federal share ($) = Non-federal share ($)
Example: $1,250,000 minus $1,000,000 = $250,000

•

Formula: Non-federal share ($) divided by Total Project Cost ($) = Non-federal share (%)
Example: $250,000 divided by $1,250,000 = 20%

cooperative agreement, then it is allowable as cost share","['Total Project Cost', 'EERE']"

needed to provide the same payback period as the FiTs modelled (for a
3 kWp system with medium demand)","['FiTs', 'kWp']"

"Based on these ﬁndings, policymakers wishing to encourage the
uptake of residential solar PV in low irradiance regions should give
consideration to grant-based supports as well as FiT/net metering
policies, as they may deliver equivalent beneﬁts compared with
remuneration schemes to consumers in terms of reducing payback
period (though, from a public expenditure perspective, other factors
such as cost to governments will also need to be considered)",[]

Table 2
Development path of strategic management theories in the context of
‘Competitive Advantage’

Table 2 (continued )
Industrial Organization Theory (IOT)
• In turbulent markets, ability of firm managers to utilize dynamic capabilities
determined whether the firm was able to sustain competitive advantage (Eisenhardt
and Martin, 2000)
• Strategy of modifying, altering, eliminating and creating new resources to compete
in uncertain markets (Sirmon, Hitt and Ireland, 2007)
• Manage volatility in the market by appropriately configuring the existing resources
(Day, 1994)
• Product development skills of managers or the strategic decision-making process as
DC (Tondolo and Bitencourt, 2014)
• Sensing the environment and seizing the opportunities for competitive advantage
(Li and Liu, 2014)
• Idiosyncratic mental models of managers and the deeply embedded values of
organizations as DC (Teece, 2018)
• Routines as ingrained characteristics of the firm are difficult to decode (Wang and
Ahmed, 2007)
• Adaptive capability - ability of firm managers to recognize the opportunities and
exploit them (Augier and Teece, 2009)
• Absorptive capability - ability of firm managers to identify useful external
information in the business environment and use it to enhance firm performance
(Flatten, Greve and Brettel, 2011)
• Innovative capability - ability of firm managers to develop new products and create
opportunities (Verona and Ravasi, 2003)
• Dynamic managerial capabilities enhance firm performance (Ambrosini and
Altintas, 2019; Helfat and Martin, 2015; Helfat and Peteraf, 2015)
• Managerial human capital - skill and knowledge that managers gain based on
educational background and personal and working experiences (Chatterji and
Patro, 2014)
• Managerial social capital - ability of managers to gain access to scarce resources
based on their connections and relationships within the industry (Blyler and Coff,
2003)
• Managerial cognition - mental models and belief systems of managers which
facilitated decision making and strategy formulation (Barrales-Molina, BenitezAmado and Perez-Arostegui, 2010)
• Main components of dynamic managerial capabilities – ‘managerial human capital’,
‘managerial social capital’ and ‘managerial cognition’ (Kor and Mesko, 2013)

Industrial Organization Theory (IOT)
• Neo classical economics (Chamberlin, 1933; Friedman, 1953)
• Structure - Conduct – Performance (SCP) (Bain, 1968; Baldwin, 1969; Bikker and
Haaf, 2002; Caves, 1972; Caves, 1980; Weiss, 1979)
• Classical view of industrial organization (Bain 1956; Mason, 1939)
• Modern view of industrial organization (Miller, 1988)
• Internal resources do not contribute to performance of the firm (Porter, 1981)
• Diamond model of competitive advantage (Porter, 1990)
• Sources of competitive advantage of a firm are present in the business environment
(Lado, Boyd and Wright, 1992)
• Market based view (Makhija, 2003)
• ‘Outside in’ view of competitiveness (Stonehouse and Snowdon, 2007)
• Industry analysis templates using Porter’s Five Forces analysis (Dobbs, 2014)
• Firms must focus on positioning their products relative to that of competitors
(Molloy and Barney, 2015)
Resource Based View (RBV)
• Internal and external growth of firms depends on the nature of resource deployment
(Penrose, 1959)
• Firms are bundles of resources (Rubin, 1973)
• Firm resources and products are complementary to each other (Wernerfelt, 1984)
• Performance of firms can be explained by differences in resources and capabilities
(Carmeli and Tishler, 2004)
• Firms which are able to outperform in the market nurture and nourish resources
more efficiently (Ireland, Hitt and Sirmon, 2003)
• Ability of firms to accumulate and deploy resources effectively (Barney, Wright and
Ketchen Jr, 2001)
• Moved understanding of firm performance from industry level to firm level
activities (Ray, Barney and Muhanna, 2004)
• Firm resources must be casually ambiguous and socially complex (Teece, 1987)
• Firm performance is enhanced when resource deployment is combined with skills,
knowledge and technology (Prahalad and Hamel,1990)
• ‘Valuable, rare, inimitable and non-substitutable’ – VRIN framework for
competitive advantage (Barney, 1991)
• Resources which are tacit and not easily identifiable are difficult to replicate (Grant,
1991)
• Resources are embedded in skills and tacit knowledge generated from human
resources (Berman, Down and Hill, 2002)
• Generation of team knowledge produces socially complex resources (Stacey, 2001)
• Utilization of resources to develop distinctive competencies (Mahoney and Pandian,
1992)
• Interaction of firm with its natural environment (Hart, 1995)
• Importance of tacit knowledge and experience (Wright, Dunford and Snell, 2001)
Knowledge Based View (KBV)
• ‘Knowledge’ is the fundamental resource which can drive firm growth (Grant,
2002)
• Knowledge is the only resource which does not erode over time as it is tacit and
intangible in nature and hence not easily replicable (Curado and Bontis, 2006)
• Tacit knowledge is the principal intangible resource in a firm (Cabrera-Suárez, De
Saá-Pérez and García-Almeida, 2001)
• Resources linked to human capital are ‘valuable and rare but also inimitable and
non-substitutable’ (Miller and Shamsie, 1996)
• Complementary association between the knowledge base and human resource skills
(Håkanson, 2010)
• Complementary association between the knowledge base and human resource skills
generate economic rents for the firm (Grant and Baden-Fuller, 1995)
• Transformation of firm processes from manual activities to digital transactions
makes KBV more relevant for organizations (Phelps, 2007)
• Learning culture drives the storage and dissemination of knowledge internally to
increase organizational learning (Sinkula, Baker and Noordewier, 1997)
• Knowledge is the most critical strategic resource for the firm (Bollinger and Smith,
2001)
• Origins of KBV are grounded in the RBV (Eisenhardt and Santos, 2002)
• Tacit knowledge is linked to individuals which makes it impossible to replicate fully
(Spraggon and Bodolica, 2017)
• Codification of tacit knowledge through the mental models of human resources
(Ambrosini and Bowman, 2001)
• Use of technology to integrate and store knowledge (Hew and Brush, 2007)
Dynamic Capabilities (DC)
• Dynamic capabilities (DC) considered as the key to competitive advantage in firms
(Teece and Pisano, 2003)
• DC transforms the nature of the ‘ordinary capabilities’ of firms into ‘higher level
capabilities’ (Winter, 2003)
• Extension of RBV to highly competitive and turbulent markets - adaptive capability,
absorptive capability and innovative capability (Ambrosini and Bowman, 2009)

"4 Project Participants
Project Sponsor
The project sponsor is an investor that leads the development of the project and is one of the
eventual equity investors in the project company or may simply be a developer that sells off the
project company to equity investors",['Project Participants\r\nProject Sponsor']
"The project sponsor leads the preparation of the bid for the
tendered CSP project",['CSP']
"The project sponsor typically forms the project company and arranges
necessary financing to realize the project through equity contributions and loans (debt service)",[]
"The project sponsor bears the risk of the project until a certain point in financing (usually up to
financial closure)",[]
"The project company is owned by the project sponsor and any other equity
investors in the project",[]
"This typically includes the project
sponsor and additional passive investors",[]
"CSP projects often have one or more of the technology providers or the EPC somewhere
upstream as a sponsor or investor in the project","['CSP', 'EPC']"
"The O&M
contractor may be an affiliate of the project sponsor but could be an independent party or may
initially be an affiliate of the EPC contractor","['O&M', 'EPC']"
"Generally, there are two types of projects: the
first is an open solicitation where the project sponsor selects a site and proposes a plant design;
the second case occurs when a very specific plant design is requested at a predetermined site,
with off-taker’s agreements (PPA) and connection agreements",[]
"The
project sponsor is typically responsible for submitting a high-quality, competitive bid",[]
"Financing
If the bid is selected for the award of the PPA, then the sponsor moves forward with financing of
the project and establishing the project company",[]
"This will kick
off the remaining detailed engineering activities, initiate procurement (if not already initiated at
project sponsor risk to meet timelines), and start the mobilization of the construction team at the
project site",[]
"During the early
stages of a project, the project sponsor may be the only equity investor in the project; or, if there
are multiple equity investors, the project sponsor usually takes the lead on the project",[]
"However,
during the development and execution phases of the project, the project sponsor usually has
control of the project",[]
"For purposes of discussion, we refer to the project sponsor and equity
investors singularly as the owner of the project",[]
"The operator may be a sponsor, particularly if one of the
sponsors is an IPP or utility company whose main business is operating CSP plants or similar
power plants","['IPP', 'CSP']"
"Once an EPC is selected, the sponsor and the OE should assure that the EPC performs as defined
in the EPC contract","['EPC', 'EPC']"
"Best Practices
• The sponsor/owner should be an active participant in all phases of the project including
development, engineering, construction, and commissioning",[]
"This can be done by
the project sponsor and IE/OE or by the EPC contractor","['IE/OE', 'EPC']"
"Commonly, the O&M company
is an affiliate of the project sponsor; but in many CSP projects, the project sponsor or the EPC
may also be a provider of key technology, often the solar field or the receiver in molten-salt
tower plants","['O&M', 'CSP']"
"In the case of CSP projects developed by one vertically integrated company, affiliates acted as
the project sponsor, primary equity investor, OE, O&M operator, EPC, and provider of the solarfield technology","['CSP', 'O&M', 'EPC']"

Econometrics models are estimated to test hypotheses, for example, whether a financial theory is supported by data or to determine if a model with estimated parameters can outperform a naïveforecast",['Econometrics']

on a mutual fund and the number of years its manager has been a professional",[]

her job in year t",[]
"For example, if a fund wished to sell 20,000,000 shares of IBM on a single day, which

"For instance, the Green Climate Fund has been
mandated since 2014 to deliver half its portfolio to adaptation projects, and in 2019
the World Bank announced it would boost its adaptation financing to USD 50 billion
by 2025, ensuring that over half its climate finance will go to adaptation","['the Green Climate Fund', 'the World Bank']"
"Projects
involving renewable energy for adaptation are gaining ground: they already
compose around 42% and 60% of projects for adaptation in the financial aid of the
Adaptation Fund and the Green Climate Fund, respectively","['Adaptation Fund', 'the Green Climate Fund']"
"The establishment of a new climate fund (currently the
Green Climate Fund [GCF]) and a separate adaptation committee within the UNFCCC
was also decided at Cancun","['Green Climate Fund', 'GCF', 'UNFCCC']"
